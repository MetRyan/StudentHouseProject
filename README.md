Functional Requirements:

The software system caters to the service needs of student apartments through predefined service packages. Each apartment has the option to purchase these packages, which may include services like cleaning, sanitation, and water delivery. Each service package comes with constraints regarding usage time, repetition cycles, and the number of service cycles. Even after exhausting the predefined services, users can still place orders for additional services, with the pricing dependent on the type of service package initially purchased.

Staff members can efficiently manage unprocessed orders, update order statuses, and handle payment processes.
